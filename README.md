# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```


# deploy em rede local 
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

# deploy em rede test

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```
